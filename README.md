# Holiday Hack Challenge 2023 Writeup

![my player avatar](/images/holidayhack.png)

This is my writeup for [SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2023](https://2023.holidayhackchallenge.com/). 
I want to preface this by saying that I have no real expertise in cyber 
security or experience with similar challenges as this. I'm my major is in
software development and I wanted to expand my knowledge beyond what I'm used
to. What I found surprising was that the skills that I have acquired in web 
development helped in quite many of the challenges.

I didn't really want to use too much AI, as I wanted to learn from this
challenge. I personally believe that learning to do things is way more
important, but I do think that AI can provide similar function as a
search engine would. I did use it a few times to meet the requirement 
however.

I did some of the Captain's Comms and Active Directory with another
player, not so much as a team but helping each other out when either
was completely stuck. Otherwise I was on my own.

The whole challenge was a fun experience, and I will surely do the next one
as well. This was really educational for a total newbie like me.

At this time, the final puzzle and the cartridges are still unfinished,
but I plan on expanding on this writeup on GitHub as soon as I have time. 
It might not make it for the submission, but so be it then.

I will probably add writeups on the other parts as I go, you can check the
commit history in case you want the version that was available prior to the
deadline. The Linux 101 writeup is made a little bit tongue in cheek.
